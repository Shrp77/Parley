# Parley

Cross-session agent-to-agent messaging with a durable store and a registry. **`SPEC.md` is
the primary artifact of this repository; the code is a reference implementation of it.** If
code and spec disagree, that is a defect in one of them, and which one is a decision, not an
assumption — do not silently change code to match spec or spec to match code.

Read `SPEC.md` before changing protocol behaviour. Open design questions live in `SPEC.md`
§17.

## Layout

```
src/Parley.Core     Domain. No I/O, no dependencies. AgentName, PairKey, Exchange,
                    WaitForGraph, and the enums.
src/Parley.Store    Persistence. SQLite via Dapper. ParleyDatabase (connection
                    factory), SchemaMigrator, WriteScope, and the repositories:
                    Exchange, Message, Agent, Conversation.
src/Parley.Broker   Orchestration. Decides when the other two run. Broker holds the
                    agent operations of SPEC.md §10.1; OperatorConsole holds §10.2.
                    Knows nothing of transports or adapters, and must not learn.
tests/Parley.Core.Tests   Domain tests. Deliberately does NOT reference Parley.Store —
                          the absent dependency is the point. Keep it that way.
tests/Parley.Store.Tests  Repository and schema-constraint tests.
tests/Parley.Broker.Tests Lifecycle, the agent operations, and the surface boundary
                          below.
tests/Parley.Spec.Tests   Checks SPEC.md: references resolve, tables are well formed, and
                          the schema it documents executes. References neither Core nor
                          Store, so a check cannot drift into asserting what the code does.
```

`plugins/parley` is the Claude Code integration and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` is the
catalogue pointing at it, so the integration versions with the protocol it configures. It ships
no MCP server configuration on purpose: Claude Code keeps a plugin's configuration in user
scope, so a bundled server would hand every repository the same `PARLEY_AGENT` — and taking the
agent's name from the launch environment is the guarantee the whole trust model rests on. An
integration for another client belongs beside it, not inside `src`.

`Parley.Core` having no I/O and no package dependencies is a design constraint, not an
accident of the current code. A `using` that pulls I/O into Core is a review finding.

**Agent operations and operator operations live on different types.** SPEC.md §10.2 warns
that an adapter surfacing an operator operation into an agent's tool set would breach §10.1,
and the protection the document offers is a naming convention — `force_conclude` is
deliberately not `conclude`. That is thin: it depends on whoever writes the adapter reading
carefully. So an adapter is handed a `Broker`, and a `Broker` has no operator operation to
bind. `SurfaceBoundaryTests` enumerates the broker's public surface and fails when it grows,
which makes adding an operation a decision about which side it belongs on rather than a
question of which class the connection was already in.

## Build and test

```
dotnet build
dotnet test
```

Tests run on Microsoft.Testing.Platform, selected in `global.json` under a `"test"` section
beside `"sdk"`. A green build is the whole lint gate: warnings are errors, documentation is
enforced, and NuGetAudit fails on high or critical advisories, so there is no separate lint
step. CI runs the matrix on Windows, Linux, and macOS because the transport claims parity
across named pipes and Unix domain sockets, and that claim is only worth making if it is
tested on all three.

## Conventions the build enforces

Breaking any of these fails the build. That is intentional: a rule the compiler cannot
enforce is a rule that decays.

| Rule | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Every public member documented | `GenerateDocumentationFile` + `TreatWarningsAsErrors`, so CS1591 is an error |
| No culture-sensitive string comparison | CA1305/CA1307/CA1310 promoted to error in `.editorconfig` |
| `ConfigureAwait(false)` in library code | CA2007 as error |
| Parameterised SQL | CA2100 as error. One suppression exists, in `SchemaMigrator.Migrate`, with a written justification. Do not add a second without one. |
| Package versions centralised | CPM; a `Version=` attribute in a csproj is a restore error |
| High/critical advisories fatal | `NuGetAudit` with NU1903/NU1904 as errors; NU1901/NU1902/NU1905 stay warnings |

Low and moderate advisories are deliberately non-fatal: a new advisory can land against a
package with no patched version yet, and if every severity blocked all work the predictable
response is that someone switches auditing off entirely.

**Documentation style:** `<remarks>` carries *why*, never a restatement of the signature.
The reasoning behind a non-obvious choice is the part that cannot be recovered by reading the
code, so it lives next to the code. Match this.

**Transitive pins:** every entry in the `Transitive pins` group of
`Directory.Packages.props` must record why it exists and when it can be removed, in the
format documented in that file. Remove a pin once the parent package's own floor has caught
up; `dotnet nuget why` shows whether it still binds. A pin with no justification becomes
permanent by default.

## Environment gotchas

Each of these cost a build cycle. Do not rediscover them.

- **A double hyphen cannot appear inside an XML comment.** A CLI flag written into a
  `.props` comment makes MSBuild reject the entire file, with an error that does not say why.
  Put CLI flags in markdown, not in `.props`/`.csproj` comments.
- **Test runner selection lives in `global.json`**, under `"test"` beside `"sdk"`. The
  `dotnet.config` INI format was dropped in .NET 10 RC2. MTP mode is all-or-nothing: every
  test project must be MTP-based.
- **xUnit v3 test projects need `<OutputType>Exe</OutputType>`.** Without it they build
  cleanly and discover zero tests.
- **`Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk` and `xunit.runner.visualstudio` must stay absent.** Both are
  VSTest-era, and the .NET 10 SDK refuses to run MTP tests through the VSTest target.
  xunit.v3 hosts its own runner and needs neither.
- **IDE0005 only runs when `GenerateDocumentationFile` is true**, which is why the test
  projects generate docs and suppress CS1591 rather than turning generation off.
- **xUnit1051** requires `TestContext.Current.CancellationToken` passed explicitly to every
  awaited call that accepts one.
- **`.slnx` solution folders need a real name**, not `/`. `<Folder Name="/">` throws an
  unhelpful `ArgumentOutOfRangeException`.
- **Package deprecation produces no build warning at all.** The CI `dependency health` job
  exists because the xUnit v2 deprecation was only caught by looking for it.

## Review gate

Two parts: a mechanical floor that runs automatically, and three human-judgement lenses that
do not.

### The floor runs as tests

`tests/Parley.Spec.Tests` checks SPEC.md the way the other projects check the code: every
section reference resolves, no markdown table is ragged, no operation name spans the §10.1 /
§10.2 boundary, the rules of §8 are numbered contiguously and all appear in its enforcement
table, and **every schema fragment in the document executes against SQLite, in the order
written**. `dotnet test` runs them; CI runs them on all three platforms.

That last one is the valuable one. §9.3 argues that invariants belong in storage because
application code can route around them, and each of those arguments is worth exactly what the
DDL carrying it is worth. Do not hand-verify a constraint and move on — add the case, so the
next edit is checked too.

Two traps this suite has already hit, both of which made checks pass while testing nothing:

- **Line endings.** SPEC.md is CRLF on Windows and LF on the Linux and macOS runners, and
  .NET anchors `$` before a bare line feed only. `SpecDocument` normalises on load. A pattern
  anchored to end-of-line otherwise matches everything on two runners and nothing on the third.
- **Trigger bodies contain semicolons.** A pattern ending at the first `;` truncates a trigger
  into something that still parses as SQL. Triggers are matched to `END;` separately, and
  `The_document_contains_a_schema` guards the extraction itself, because a regex that silently
  matches nothing makes every other check pass by vacuity.

### The lenses are for what the floor cannot check

Each finding nothing above low severity:

1. Correctness and concurrency
2. Security and data integrity
3. API surface and maintainability

Rotating the lens matters — three runs of the same review are correlated and mostly re-derive
the first. After fixing findings, **re-run the same lens** before moving to the next; fixes
have introduced new problems that only the re-run caught.

**Run to convergence, not to a fixed count.** "Three green" is not three passes; it is passes
repeated until one finds nothing above low severity. A pass that finds something means the
branch was not green, so fix it and go round again — including the lenses already run, because
a fix is a change and changes are what the lenses are for. Stop when a full rotation turns up
nothing worth acting on, and say how many rounds it took.

The failure this corrects is specific and was repeated: running each lens once, fixing what it
found, verifying the build still passes, and reporting green. A build that passes is not a
review. The verification sweep at the end confirms the fixes did not break anything; it does
not look for what the fixes introduced.

The highest-value findings in this repository's history came from adversarially probing a
guard rather than reading it: a self-referral that asserted both halves of a contradiction, a
gate cycle that no sub-question could ever resolve, a forged `parley:broker` responder, an
agent able to write `ghosted` over its own answered exchanges. None were visible by
inspection; all were found by writing the malicious case and watching it be admitted. **Probe;
do not reason.**

### Two rules about running them

**Run the lenses after the last edit, not alongside it.** Reviewing while authoring and then
continuing to change things means reporting passes that never covered the final state. This
has been caught by the user three separate times.

**Verify CI ran against `HEAD`.** `gh pr checks --watch` returns the *previous* run when a new
one has not yet registered, which reports green for a commit that was never built — the same
shape as reading the dependency graph before restoring. Compare the run's commit against
`git rev-parse HEAD`.

## Repository hygiene

This repository is public and its git history goes with it. No trace of the originating
private project may appear in any commit, in code, comments, tests, or fixtures. Placeholder
agents are `orders`, `billing`, and `inventory` throughout.

Before committing, run a case-insensitive `git grep` for the originating project's names,
excluding `.gitignore`. The literal term list is deliberately not written here: this file is
committed, so inlining the terms would make it fail its own check. Keep the list out of
tracked files.

Squash-merge only, so the **PR title becomes the commit message** on `main`. Conventional
Commits. Design rationale goes in the PR body — that is the durable record.

## Standing constraints

These are the premises. A change that contradicts one is a design change, not an
implementation detail, and needs to be argued rather than assumed.

- **The protocol is the product; the transport is disposable.** If a platform ships native
  cross-session messaging, Parley should run over it rather than compete with it. Keep the
  transport behind an interface.
- **Terseness is a security control.** The 2,000-character message cap is a
  context-poisoning defence, not a style preference. It lives in the schema so no code path
  can route around it.
- **No agent has authority over another.** There is no orchestrator and no lead. Any design
  that introduces one contradicts the premise.
- **Credentials are references, never values.** `env:`, `keychain:`, `file:`. The broker
  resolves them at invocation and never persists or logs them. This is what makes the
  manifest safe to commit.
